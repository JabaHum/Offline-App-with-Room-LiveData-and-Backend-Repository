      - Used in Action Bar and in AndroidManifest to tell the device the name of this app. It's  -
      - good practice to keep this short, so if your app's name was "The Greatest movie App    -
      - In the History of Mankind", your launcher icon isn't displayed with "The greatest Wea"   -
      - or something similar.                                                                    -
